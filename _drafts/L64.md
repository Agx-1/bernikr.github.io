title: The L64 Coordinate System
---

One day browsing the internet I stumbled upon [what3words][], a website
promising to simplify the way we use coordinates. Instead of using two numbers
for latitude and longitude they use 3 words. They do this by using a grid of 57
trillion 3x3m squares and an proprietary algorithm to map every square to a
unique 3 word address.

As much as I like the vision of making coordinates easier to handle, I have a
few issues with it:

1. Their convert algorithm is proprietary
2. It has a fixed resolution of 3 meters
3. In order to convert coordinates you need an arbitrary wordlist of at least
    40&#8239;000 words
4. Did I already tell you that its algorithm is proprietary and
    [patented][w3w-patent]?
